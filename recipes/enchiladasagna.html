<h3>Description</h3>
  <p>Enchiladas are amazing. Casseroles are amazing. Enchilada casserole would be an appropriate name, but I always think of this dish as lasagna-esque, so to me it has always been and will always be that: "Enchiladasagna". </p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Onions, bell peppers, spicy peppers</li>
    <li>Corn tortillas</li>
    <li>Shredded cheese</li>
    <li>Black beans</li>
    <li>Enchilada sauce of your choice</li>
    <li>Optional: Olives, protein like pulled chicken or ground pork</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol> 
    <li>Cook down your onions and peppers with a healthy amount of seasoning; I like cumin and paprika.</li>
    <li>Add black beans to the veggies once everything is lightly browned and tender. Reseason to taste.</li>
    <li>In a 2-3 inch deep casserole dish, put down a layer of corn tortillas.</li>  
    <li>Dollop 1/3 of your bean/onion/pepper mixture over top of the tortillas.</li>
    <li>Add a generous amount of shredded cheese and enchilada sauce, completely covering this layer.</li>
    <li>Repeat those steps to add a total of three layers, covering the third layer with tortillas and topping with more cheese and enchilada sauce.</li>
    <li>Bake for 30-45 mintues at 400 degrees or until the top is golden brown and crispy.</li>
